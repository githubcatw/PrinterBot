It's something I made a while ago. I found this useful at the time but don't use it anymore, and would probably write this bot in Go or Python now if I did find it useful. This bot is licensed under the MIT license, so if you want to improve it feel free to fork this repo.

# PrinterBot
 Telegram bot that prints anything sent to it.
